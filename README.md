# Musickr

Musickr is a Web App that lets you listen to and watch the creations of authors from a specific location! It uses SoundCloud and Flickr databases.

The application is based on ASP.NET Core (C#) and ReactJS (TypeScript).

## Start the app

First, you need to install .NET 7 and NodeJS v18.

```
brew install dotnet
brew install node # Or node@18
```

> .NET 7 works on any OS (MacOS, Linux or Windows), and works natively with Apple Silicon.

Then, go to `Musickr/Musickr.App/ClientApp` and do a `npm install`.

Finally, go to `Musickr/Musickr.App` and launch the application with `dotnet watch run debug` !
